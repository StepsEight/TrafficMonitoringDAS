Because GitHub has a limit of 100MB for file upload size, in order to facilitate the download of the files, we have placed them on Google Drive. In order to avoid any commercial information in the video, we have edited the footage to only include non-sensitive vehicle footage of the roads. The video reference can be quickly downloaded from the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AABKO_ugMzKqAa1gOQZSpwqreekb-I-_?usp=sharing
