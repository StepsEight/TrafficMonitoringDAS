### An Open-source data for traffic monitoring using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) in the Cross-Harbour Tunnel from PolyU

This repository is the usage page of the PolyU_trafficMonitoringDAS dataset. Based on optical fiber cables in exiting telecommunication infrastructure, the phase-sensitive Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (Phi-OTDR) technique is applied into traffic monitoring applications to achieve vehicle detection, tracking and even classification. However, these traffic monitoring studies are mainly carried out under the relatively sparse traffic environments such as rural areas, university campuses, national highways or expressways. In busy traffic environments, the vibration signals caused by dense vehicles form complex patterns, which makes it difficult to well separate the vehicle trajectories. To develop algorithms under high traffic conditions will advance the application of this technology in ensuring the safety of transportation assets in busy urban areas in the future. **In short, PolyU_trafficMonitoringDAS dataset poses a special focus on developing DAS traffic monitoring applications in busy traffic environment.**

Key words: **Distributed Acoustic Sensing**, **Traffic Monitoring**, **Busy Traffic Environmnet**
