### An Open-source data for traffic monitoring using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) in metropolitan environment

This repository is the usage page of the TrafficMonitoringDAS dataset. Based on optical fiber cables in exiting telecommunication infrastructure, the phase-sensitive Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (Phi-OTDR) technique is applied into traffic monitoring applications to achieve vehicle detection, tracking and even classification. However, these traffic monitoring studies are mainly carried out under the relatively sparse traffic environments such as rural areas, university campuses, national highways or expressways. In busy traffic environments, the vibration signals caused by dense vehicles form complex patterns, which makes it difficult to well separate the vehicle trajectories. To develop algorithms under high traffic conditions will advance the application of this technology in ensuring the safety of transportation assets in busy urban areas in the future. **In short, TrafficMonitoringDAS dataset poses a special focus on developing DAS traffic monitoring applications in busy traffic environment.**

Key words: **Distributed Acoustic Sensing**, **Traffic Monitoring**, **Busy Traffic Environmnet**

## The traffic dataset in Hong Kong from PolyU
### Experimental setup
The shared sensor data is collected from a road which is a 1.86-kilometer two-way two-lane road. The optical fiber cable contains over 100 co-routed fibers (some with live communication traffic) and as shown in Fig. 1, the cable is deployed in the trench on one side of the road. Therefore, the collected DAS data mainly captures the vibrations induced by vehicles coming from one direction, but in the low-frequency range, the signals from the opposite direction can also be detected. In this experiment, we used a typical single-frequency optical pulses DAS with a gauge length of 3.75m and sampling interval of 1.25m to collect 15-minute strain rate data with 2kHz temporal sampling rate. The speeds of the collected vehicles are generally within the range of 50 to 60 kilometers per hour. The sensor data from are saved as mat files. To ensure the integrity of the downloaded files, each file records traffic vibration signals for 5 minutes. The high-resolution sensing performance ensures the separability of vehicle trajectories in this high-traffic scenario, making it suitable for verifying the performance of vehicle detection and tracking algorithms. In addition, a camera was set on a nearby overpass bridge, and the corresponding video footage is also available for the matching/verifications between vehicles and DAS vibration traces, which will be a good benchmark to characterize the performance of various algorithms for vehicle detection, tracking, classifications and speed estimation etc.

### Signal enhancement for weak vehicle signals

In urban traffic scenarios, there are various types of vehicles. Vehicles with greater mass generate vibration signals of larger amplitude, which can easily mask the signals of smaller vehicles. As shown in **Fig. 3 (a)**, the distinct vehicle trajectories collected are caused by the double-decker buses, while the signals of the middle small vehicles are masked. To clear the weak vehicle signals, we proposed the **block normalization algorithm**. The $M \times N$ input image is partitioned into non-overlapping rectangular blocks of size $k \times l$, indexed by $i = \lfloor M/k \rfloor$ along the rows and $j = \lfloor N/l \rfloor$ along the columns. Each block is normalized independently as:

$$
B_{i,j}^"(m,n) = \frac{B_{i,j}^’(m,n) - \min(B_{i,j}^’)}{\max(B_{i,j}^’) - \min(B_{i,j}^’) + \epsilon} \tag{1}
$$
where $B_{i,j}^’$ is the absolute value expression of each block $B_{i,j}$, $m \in [0,k-1]$ and $n \in [0,l-1]$ denote the local coordinates within the block, $\epsilon$ is a small constant for preventing division by zero.

Given that vehicle strain rate signals persist for approximately 2 seconds, the block size is reduced to [1.5s 12m] and the original signal is block-normalized as shown in Fig. 3 (b), thereby avoiding the coverage of high-amplitude signals and enables the visibility of weak vehicle trajectories.
